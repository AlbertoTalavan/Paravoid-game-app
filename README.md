#### Paravoid is a space shooter (without the shooter part) where your goal is to stay alive as much time as possible.  

It is not yet ready, but ... **comming soon to iPhone / iPad devices**


### Current state
- at this moment IÂ´m working on an complement app whose motivation is to be able to test the backgrounds previously to introduce them in the game.
